# C++ Particle Simulator
## Idea
* I want to make a 2D particle simulator in C++ using SFML
* The focus of this simulator will be on electromagnetism
* Particles will have position, velocity, mass, and a charge
* You will be able to add particles
* Basic GUI 
## Current Features
* 2D particle simulator opens with a 800x600 window
* right click spawns positive particles, left click spawns negatives
* particles obey Coulomb's law & Lorentz force
* FPS + Particle Count HUD
* Electric field lines
* Press up/down to increase/decrease simulation speed
